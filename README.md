## Written Instructions ([Railway.app](https://railway.app?referralCode=7ENqQl))

### Creating your Discord Bot ([based on discordpy docs](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/discord.html))

1. Make sure you’re logged on to the [Discord website](https://discord.com/).
2. Navigate to the [application page](https://discord.com/developers/applications).
3. Click on the blue "New application" button at the top-right.
4. Give the application a name and click “Create”.
5. In the left sidebar, click on the "Bot" tab and select "Add bot"
6. Give your bot a cool username and icon. This is what how it'll appear in the server.
7. Take note of the bot token, as you will need to add it to your code in the next section.
8. You can leave the remaining "Authorization Flow" and "Privileged Gateway Intents" options unchecked, unless you believe they apply to your project.
9. It's now time to invite your bot to your server. Head to the left sidebar and click on OAuth2 > URL Generator.
10. In "Scopes", check the "bot" option
11. Under "Bot Permissions", select "Administrator". I have not tested other permissions, but feel free to select other ones if you wish.
12. Copy the Generated URL, and open the link.
13. Add the bot to the respective server.

### Creating your Code Repository

1. Create a private clone of [this repository](https://github.com/havecookie/haveacookie) on GitHub. Make sure this repo is set to private, as you will be adding sensitive information in the later steps.
2. In your repo, select the `data` folder, and click on [`config.json`](https://github.com/havecookie/haveacookie/blob/main/data/config.json)
3. Edit the variables for your custom bot. You can customize the emoji, prefix, max per day, prizes, and prize channel. Note that for the prizes, the `"redeemInstructions"` text is only visible once the prize has been successfully purchased.
4. IMPORTANT: Make sure to add the bot token (from the previous section), and database URL (next section)

### Hosting your bot

1. If you don't have one already, [create a Railway.app account](https://railway.app?referralCode=7ENqQl)
2. Create a new Project, and select "Deploy from GitHub repo".
3. In the same "New Project" window, also select "Provision PostgreSQL".
4. Once everything is deployed in Railway, select the project and click on the rectangle with the GitHub repo's name.
5. On the right window, click on the "Settings" tab, and in the "Environment" section, make sure the automatic deployment trigger is enabled.
6. Afterwards, click on the PostgreSQL rectangle.
7. On the right window, click on the "Connect" tab, and copy the "Postgres Connection URL".

### Updating code with Database URL

1. In your GitHub repository, return to [`config.json`](https://github.com/havecookie/haveacookie/blob/main/data/config.json) and paste the Postgres Connection URL as the value for `"databaseUrl" :`. For example:
2. Saving these changes will trigger the deployment of an updated Railway project.
3. Your bot should now be live and working.

### Registering slash commands

1. Add your Discord app `clientId` in `config.json`.
2. Optionally add `guildId` for faster, guild-scoped command updates while testing.
3. Run `npm run register-commands` after changing slash commands.

### Running the bot (TypeScript build)

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Build: `npm run build`
3. Start: `npm start`

### Lint and format checks

1. Check formatting: `npm run format:check`
2. Run lint: `npm run lint`
3. Fix formatting: `npm run format`

### Docker image

- Runtime base image: `gcr.io/distroless/nodejs24-debian13`
- Published image: `ghcr.io/aldy505/haveacookie`
- Tags:
  - `sha-<shortsha>`: published when image workflow runs
  - `edge`: published from `main`
  - `latest`: published only for `release/published`

### Docker Compose

1. Ensure your local `config.json` uses `postgres` as the database host (for example: `postgres://haveacookie:haveacookie@postgres:5432/haveacookie`).
2. Start services: `docker compose up -d`
3. Stop services: `docker compose down`

### Testing the Bot

1. Give a reward: In any channel where the bot is present, `@` mention a fellow user followed by the emoji. For example, `"thanks for the help @candidexmedia :cookie:"`
2. List of Prizes: Direct message the bot using your prefix set in [`config.json`](https://github.com/havecookie/haveacookie/blob/main/data/config.json) followed by `prizes` (no space) (ie: "`!prizes`").
3. Purchase a Prize: Direct message the bot using your prefix set in [`config.json`](https://github.com/havecookie/haveacookie/blob/main/data/config.json) followed by `prizes` and the prize number (ie: "`!prizes 1`" for the first prize listed in the prize list).
4. Leaderboard + Check Balance: use `/leaderboard` in your server.
5. Profile + Rank Progression: use `/profile` to view current rank, tagline, total given/received, daily give usage, and progress to the next rank.

# About the project

I commissioned this bot from a freelancer on Fiverr named [mdaniels6758](www.fiverr.com/mdaniels6758). I made some modifications and decided to open source the project in the hopes that it will benefit other Discord users, and that improvements can be brought to the project collectively.
